## Overview 🚀
This project explores the fascinating intersection of **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity**, featuring simulations and visualizations that delve into the universe's deepest mysteries.

### Key Features:
1. Simulate **quantum propagation intervals** and **gravitational redshifts**.
2. Analyze **Lorentz factors** and relativistic effects.
3. Visualize black hole **event horizons** in 3D.

## How to Run on Kaggle (No Installation Required!) 🐾

The code for this project is contained in `quantum_propagation_interval.py`. You can run it directly on Kaggle without installing anything locally:

1. Visit [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Copy and paste the contents of `quantum_propagation_interval.py` into the Kaggle notebook editor.
4. Click **Run All** to execute the cells and explore the simulations.

Kaggle automatically provides all required Python libraries, so there’s no need to install anything manually.

## Visualizations 📊
1. **Combined Results**: Compare quantum intervals, redshifts, Lorentz factors, and energies.
2. **Event Horizon 3D View**: See how spacetime bends near a black hole.
3. **Pairplot Analysis**: Correlations between mass, distance, and velocity.
