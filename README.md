# Quantum and Relativistic Physics Simulation

This repository contains a Python script designed to explore and visualize key concepts in quantum mechanics, relativity, and astrophysics. By leveraging computational tools, the script simulates and visualizes various phenomena, including black hole dynamics, quantum propagation intervals, gravitational redshift, and Lorentz corrections. 

## Features

- **Quantum Propagation Interval Simulation**: Computes the interval using mass-energy equivalence and NIST-defined relationships.
- **Relativistic Lorentz Correction**: Calculates time dilation and relativistic effects for given velocities.
- **Gravitational Redshift**: Simulates the redshift caused by massive bodies over various distances.
- **Rotational Kinetic Energy**: Computes the kinetic energy of rotating bodies like planets and stars.
- **Black Hole Visualization**: A 3D funnel visualization demonstrating escape paths to mirrored planes.
- **Combined Advanced Plots**: Presents relationships among key physics parameters such as quantum intervals, redshift, Lorentz factors, and rotational energies.

## Prerequisites

The script runs in the Python environment on **Kaggle.com**, which provides pre-installed libraries for numerical and graphical operations. You can also run it locally with the following dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Install these using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
